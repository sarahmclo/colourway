## Design

### Design Philosophy

Our design ethos is rooted in the idea that less is more. We've embraced clean lines, minimalist layouts, and bold colour choices to create an interface that is both visually striking and easy to navigate. Every element has been carefully considered to ensure a seamless user experience, from the intuitive navigation menu to the vibrant colour palettes that adorn each page.

### Design Choices

While our design may be simple, that doesn't mean it's lacking in impact. We've made bold choices in our use of colour and typography to create a website that stands out from the crowd. Vibrant hues and eye-catching fonts draw the user's attention and create a memorable visual identity for our brand.

### Colours
Our colour palette is carefully selected to evoke the emotions and feelings associated with our brand. Vibrant yet harmonious colors create a visually appealing experience while maintaining readability and accessibility for all users.
