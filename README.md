## Design <a name="design"></a>

### Design Philosophy
Our design ethos is rooted in the idea that less is more. We've embraced clean lines, minimalist layouts, and bold colour choices to create an interface that is both visually striking and easy to navigate. We have chosen to keep most elements to one page as we beliebve it suits the flow of the company ethos. Every element has been carefully considered to ensure a seamless user experience, from the intuitive navigation menu to the vibrant colour palettes that adorn each page.

The site is designed mobile first with the use of media queries for larger screens.

### Design Choices
While our design may be simple, that doesn't mean it's lacking in impact. We've made bold choices in our use of colour and typography to create a website that stands out from the crowd. Vibrant images and eye-catching fonts draw the user's attention and create a memorable visual identity for our brand.

- **Reference Images**
Strong lines, simple shapes with a nod to the Bauhaus movement are our inspiration, as seen in the reference imagery below.

![ref-pic](docs/images/references/ref-images.webp)

### Colour Scheme
Our colour palette is carefully selected to evoke the emotions and feelings associated with our brand. Vibrant yet harmonious colours create a visually appealing experience, along with negative sapce and clean dark lines, while maintaining readability and accessibility for all users.

- **Colour Palette**
The colour palette for this site was devised inkeeping with the Colourway logo and created in [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/).

- **Logo**
The Colourway logo was created in Adobe Illustrator/Photoshop and a starting point for the clean look of the website.

### Typography

![Roboto](docs/images/fonts/roboto.webp)

### Imagery
We believe in the power of imagery to tell a story and evoke emotions. From striking photographs to subtle background textures, every image on our website is carefully chosen to complement our content and reinforce our brand identity.

- **Hero Image**
