## Design <a name="design"></a>

### Design Philosophy
Our design ethos is rooted in the idea that less is more. We've embraced clean lines, minimalist layouts, and bold colour choices to create an interface that is both visually striking and easy to navigate. Every element has been carefully considered to ensure a seamless user experience, from the intuitive navigation menu to the vibrant colour palettes that adorn each page.

### Design Choices
While our design may be simple, that doesn't mean it's lacking in impact. We've made bold choices in our use of colour and typography to create a website that stands out from the crowd. Vibrant hues and eye-catching fonts draw the user's attention and create a memorable visual identity for our brand.

Strong lines, simple shapes with a nod to the Bauhaus movement are our inspiration as seen in the reference imagery below.
